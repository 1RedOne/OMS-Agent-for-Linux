# Calling sequence for RPM pre/post scripts, during upgrade, is as follows:
#   1. Run the %pre section of the RPM being installed.
#   2. Install the files that the RPM provides.
#   3. Run the %post section of the RPM.
#   4. Run the %preun of the old package.
#   5. Delete any old files not overwritten by the newer version.
#      (This step deletes files that the new package does not require.)
#   6. Run the %postun hook of the old package.
#
# Thus, if we're an upgrade, skip all of this cleanup
